## Overview

Music player and server for ownCloud and Nextcloud. Shows audio files stored in your cloud categorized by artists and albums. Supports mp3, and depending on the browser, many other audio formats too. Supports shuffle play and playlists. The Music app also allows serving audio files from your cloud to external applications which are compatible either with Ampache or Subsonic.

## Supported formats

* MP3 (`audio/mpeg`)
* FLAC (`audio/flac`)
* Vorbis in OGG container (`audio/ogg`)
* Opus in OGG container (`audio/ogg` or `audio/opus`)
* WAV (`audio/wav`)
* AAC in M4A container (`audio/mp4`)
* ALAC in M4A container (`audio/mp4`)
* M4B (`audio/m4b`)
* AAC (`audio/aac`)
* AIFF (`audio/aiff`)
* AU (`audio/basic`)
* CAF (`audio/x-caf`)

_Note: The audio formats supported vary depending on the browser. Most recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge should be able to play all the formats listed above. All browsers should be able to play at least the MP3 files._

### Detail

The modern web browsers ship with a wide variety of built-in audio codecs which can be used directly via the standard HTML5 audio API. Still, there is no browser which could natively play all the formats listed above. For those formats not supported natively, the Music app utilizes the Aurora.js javascript library which is able to play most of the formats listed above, excluding only the OGG containers. On the other hand, Aurora.js may not be able to play all the individual files of the supported formats and is very limited in features (no seeking, no adjusting of playback speed).

_Note: In order to be playable in the Music app, the file type has to be mapped to a MIME type `audio/*` on your cloud instance. Neither ownCloud nor Nextcloud has these mappings by default for the file types AIFF, AU, or CAF. The mapping for the file type AAC is missing from ownCloud but present on Nextcloud. To add the missing mappings, run:_

	php occ music:register-mime-types

## Usage hints

Normally, the Music app detects any new audio files in the filesystem on application start and scans metadata from those to its database tables when the user clicks the prompt. The Music app also detects file removals and modifications on the background and makes the required database changes automatically.

If the database would somehow get corrupted, the user can force it to be rebuilt from scratch by opening the Settings (at the bottom of the left pane) and clicking the option "Reset music collection".

### Commands

If preferred, it is also possible to use the command line tool for the database maintenance, see https://github.com/owncloud/music/wiki/Commands. This may be quicker than scanning via the web UI in case of large music library, and optionally allows targeting more than one user at once, as well as some more options not available on the web interface.


### Ampache and Subsonic

The URL you need to connect with an Ampache-compatible player is listed in the settings and looks like this:

```
https://cloud.domain.org/index.php/apps/music/ampache
```

This is the common path. Most clients append the last part (`/server/xml.server.php`) automatically. If you have connection problems, try the longer version of the URL with the `/server/xml.server.php` appended.

Similarly, the URL used to connect with a Subsonic-compatible player is listed in the settings and looks like this:

```
https://cloud.domain.org/index.php/apps/music/subsonic
```


#### Authentication

Ampache and Subsonic don't use your ownCloud password for authentication. Instead, you need to use a specifically generated APIKEY with them.
The APIKEY is generated through the Music app settings accessible from the link at the bottom of the left pane within the app. The generated APIKEY is shown upon creation but it is impossible to retrieve it at later time. If you forget or misplace the key, you can always delete it and generate a new one.

When you create the APIKEY, the application shows also the username you should use on your Ampache/Subsonic client. Typically, this is your ownCloud login name but it may also be an UUID in case you have set up LDAP authentication.


### Installation

The Music app can be installed using the App Management available on the web UI of ownCloud or Nextcloud for the admin user.

After installation, you may want to select a specific sub-folder containing your music files through the settings of the application. This can be useful to prevent unwanted audio files to be included in the music library.

### Known issues

#### Huge music collections

The application's scalability for large music collections has gradually improved as new versions have been released. Still, if the collection is large enough, the application may fail to load. The maximum number of tracks supported depends on your server but should be more than 50'000. Also, when there are tens of thousands of tracks, you may notice slow down of the web UI.

#### Translations

There exist partial translations for the Music app for many languages, but most of them are very much incomplete. In the past, the application was translated at https://www.transifex.com/owncloud-org/owncloud/ and the resource still exists there. However, large majority of the strings used in the app have not been picked by Transifex for many years now, and hence the translations from Transifex cannot be actually used. The root cause is disparity in the localization mechanisms used in the Music app and on ownCloud in general, and bridging the gap would require some support from ownCloud core team. This is probably never going to happen, see https://central.owncloud.org/t/owncloud-music-app-translations/14881. For now, you may contribute translations as normal pull requests, by following the instructions from https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/671#issuecomment-782746463.

#### SMB storage

The Music app may be unable to extract metadata of the files residing on a SMB share. This is because, on some system configurations, it is not possible to use `fseek()` function to seek within the remote files on the SMB share. The `getID3` library used for metadata extraction depends on `fseek()` and will fail on such systems. If the metadata extraction fails, the Music app falls back to deducing the track name from the file name, album name from the parent folder name, and artist name from the grand parent folder name. Whether or not the problem exists on a system, may depend on the details of the SMB support library on the host computer and the remote computer providing the share. According to the [documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_files/external_storage/smb.html), using the SMB storage requires either `smbclient` or `libsmbclient-php` and the latter is preferred. Installing the `libsmbclient-php` has solved this metadata issue for some users.

## Development

### Build frontend bundle

All the frontend javascript sources of the Music app, including the used vendor libraries, are bundled into a few files for deployment using webpack. These bundle files are named like `dist/webpack.*.js`. Similarly, all the style files of the Music app are bundled into files like `dist/webpack.*.css`. Downloading the vendor libraries and generating these bundles requires the `npm` utility, and happens by running:

	npm install --deps
	npm run build

The command above builds the minified production version of the bundle. To build the development version, use

	npm run build-dev

To automatically regenerate the development mode bundles whenever the source .js/.css files change, use

	npm run watch

### Build delivery package

To build the release zip package, run the following commands. This requires the `make` and `zip` command line utilities.

	cd build
	make release

### Install test dependencies

To install test dependencies, run the following command on the root level of the project:

	composer install

### Run tests

#### Static analysis with PHPStan

	composer run analyze

#### PHP unit tests

	composer run unit-tests

#### PHP integration tests
The integration tests require the music app to be installed under the `apps` folder of an ownCloud or Nextcloud installation. The following steps assume that the cloud installation in question has not been taken into use yet, e.g. it's a fresh clone from github.

	cd ../..          # owncloud/nextcloud core
	php occ maintenance:install --admin-user admin --admin-pass admin --database sqlite
	php occ app:enable music
	cd apps/music
	composer run integration-tests

#### Behat acceptance tests

	cd tests
	cp behat.yml.dist behat.yml
	# add cloud URL and credentials for Ampache and Subsonic APIs to behat.yml
	../vendor/bin/behat

For the acceptance tests, you need to upload all the tracks from the following zip file to your cloud instance: https://github.com/paulijar/music/files/2364060/testcontent.zip

### Translation scripts

The translatable strings are extracted from the front-end files of the Music app proper using the `angular-gettext` module. This is installed among other dependencies with `npm`.

In addition, there are some translatable strings within the back-end code and in the front-end files for the embedded Files player and for the Nextcloud Dashboard widget. These are handled using the perl script `l10n/l10n.pl`. In addition to the perl interpreter, this script requires the module `Locale::PO` (can be installed with CPAN) and the `xgettext` tool. On Linux, the latter should be available with `apt-get install gettext` or similar. On Windows, this needs to be installed manually and the executable must be added to the PATH; at least the version 0.22.5 from https://github.com/vslavik/gettext-tools-windows/releases seems to work well.

When the tools are setup correctly, all the strings can be extracted from the source codes to `l10n/templates/music.pot` with the command:

	cd build
	make l10n-extract

The music.pot file can then be used to update the language-specific translation file (l10n/*/music.po) as described in https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/671#issuecomment-782746463.

Once the translations have been updated in the .po files, we need to generate the final source files used to build the Music application. This, again, uses both `angular-gettext` and `l10n/l10n.pl`. For this, execute

	cd build
	make l10n-clone
	make l10n-compile

The step `l10n-clone` above makes copies of some translations to different language codes. This is needed because ownCloud and Nextcloud use slightly different language codes in some cases. Furthermore, the clouds may support multiple versions of the same language but the Music app currently has identical translation for each of them.

## API

The Music app back-end implements the [Shiva API](https://shiva.readthedocs.org/en/latest/resources/base.html) except the resource `/artists/<int:artist_id>/shows`. The endpoints of this API can be found under `https://own.cloud.example.org/index.php/apps/music/api/`. The Shiva API could be used by other applications running on ownCloud/Nextcloud to access the library contents. This API is accessible only with a valid cloud user session which makes it difficult to use for clients running outside of the hosting cloud.

To connect external client applications, partial implementations of the following APIs are available:

* [Ampache XML API](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/XML-methods) at `/ampache/server/xml.server.php`
* [Ampache JSON API](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/JSON-methods) at `/ampache/server/json.server.php`
* [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) at `/subsonic/rest/{method}`

The web interface of the Music app uses a proprietary REST API. Note that this API may change between the application versions without prior notice. For list of all available endpoints, see [appinfo/routes.php](https://github.com/owncloud/music/blob/master/appinfo/routes.php). As this API is not documented anywhere, the details of each endpoint have to be checked from the implementation. See [here](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/1012#issuecomment-1256943457) for some hints.


### `/api/log`

Allows to log a message to ownCloud defined log system.

	POST /api/log

Parameters:

	{
		"message": "The message to log"
	}

Response:

	{
		"success": true
	}


### `/api/collection`

Returns all artists with nested albums and each album with nested tracks. Each track carries a file ID which can be used to obtain the file path with `/api/file/{fileId}/path`. The front-end converts the path into playable WebDAV link like this: `OC.linkToRemoteBase('webdav') + path`.

	GET /api/collection

Response:

	[

	]

### Creating APIKEY for Subsonic/Ampache

The endpoint `/api/settings/userkey/generate` may be used to programmatically generate a random password to be used with an Ampache or a Subsonic client. The endpoint expects two parameters, `length` and `description` (both optional) and returns a JSON response.
Please note that the minimum password length is 10 characters. The HTTP return codes represent also the status of the request.

```
POST /api/settings/userkey/generate
```

Parameters:

```
{
	"length": <length>,
	"description": <description>
}
```

Response (success):

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created

{
	"id": <userkey_id>,
	"password": <random_password>,
	"description": <description>
}
```

Response (error - no description provided):

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request

{
	"message": "Please provide a description"
}
```

Response (error - error while saving password):

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error

{
	"message": "Error while saving the credentials"
}
```
